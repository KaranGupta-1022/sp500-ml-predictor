# sp500-ml-predictor
Python project that uses machine learning to predict S&amp;P 500 prices. Includes data collection, model training, testing, and results.

## Project Description
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the price movements of the S&P 500 index. It includes modules for data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The goal is to provide insights into market trends and the effectiveness of various ML models for financial forecasting.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
	```powershell
	git clone https://github.com/KaranGupta-1022/sp500-ml-predictor.git
	cd sp500-ml-predictor
	```
2. **Set up a Python environment:**
	- It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
	  ```powershell
	  python -m venv venv
	  .\venv\Scripts\activate
	  ```
## Usage
1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
	- Open `smp.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
	- Follow the cells to collect data, train models, and visualize results.
2. **Modify and experiment:**
	- You can edit the notebook to try different models, features, or data sources.

## Notes
- Ensure you have internet access for data collection (e.g., using yfinance).
- Results may vary based on model parameters and data timeframe.
